# NestJS Backend Template (Simplified)
This is template information page. If you are looking for startup page - check [START.md](START.md)

Original repo: https://github.com/siranweb/nest-backend-template

Differences:
- `postgres` was switched to `sqlite`
- No need to run docker locally

## New project checklist
* [ ] Update `package.json`, `package-lock.json` to change project name, etc.
* [ ] Update `START.md`
* [ ] Delete `README.md` and rename `START.md` to `README.md`
